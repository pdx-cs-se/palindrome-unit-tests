# palindrome-unit-tests: unit test demo
Jeremy Vonderfecht and Bart Massey

A "proven correct" function for identifying palindromes, and
a suite of unit tests for this function. The "proof",
included in the source code, is quite casual. The unit tests
cover some sample cases plus exhaustive testing up to fixed
lengths.

Say `make test` to run the tests.

Requires Googletest unit test framework: `libgtest-dev` on
Debian Linux.
